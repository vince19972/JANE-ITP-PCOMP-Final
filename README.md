## Arduino & p5.js Interaction

- Open one terminal window, `cd` to directory `serial-communication`
  - For local static server, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  - For serial communication, run application `p5.serialcontrol`. Remember to change `portName` variable at the start of the program before creating the port.
